# GithubApp

When running GUI, you will see a login window. After entering username and login window, you will see a new window stating the user's favourite languages. You should have a nice working app. However, this app does not handle the requestException when user enter not existing username and password. In addition, the connection does not check the user password.

There are also some tests about LanguageCounter and Connector.
